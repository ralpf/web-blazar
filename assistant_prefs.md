# Assistant Preferences (for GitHub Copilot)

These are the user's preferences for how the assistant should behave while working in this repository.

- Keep answers short and easy to read.
- If unsure about anything, ask a clarifying question instead of guessing.
- Do NOT modify any existing files or project content unless I explicitly ask you to.
- I may allow specific actions (e.g., create this file) — follow explicit permission only.
- Preserve repository structure and code style when making changes (only when asked).

If a requested change requires more context, ask one focused question.
Thank you — keep responses concise.
